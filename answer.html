        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
<p class="text-xl">  
    answer: <span class="font-normal text-2xl"> Document Object Model.</span> The interaction is done with a programming language or JavaScript. Now since DOM is an object representation, we have properties, methods like any other JavaScript object. With the help of which we can access everything on our page, modify it easily if needed.</p>

<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods?</h1>
<p>answer: 
    Here, since DOM adds methods to work with our pages, we can easily do something on an HTML page:

<ul>
    <li>Creating a new element</li>
    <li>Remove any previous element</li>
    <li>Modify any previous element</li>
    <li>Modify, add, remove attributes</li>
    <li>Add, remove, modify styling</li>
    <li>Create events on the page to perform a specific action on the page when something like this happens</li>
    <li>Creating events on a specific element, when something happens on this element we want to take such an action.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">3. What is event bubble?</h1>
<p> answer: 
    The bubbles read-only property of the Event interface indicates whether the event bubbles up through the DOM tree or not.
</p>
<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
<p> answer: 
    In JavaScript, functions are objects. Can we pass objects to functions as parameters? we can also pass functions as parameters to other functions and call them inside the outer functions.
